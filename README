This is a AS3 library to interact with Wprdpress's XMLRPC features.

The code is almost entirely written by Reuben Stanton (http://blog.absentdesign.com/about/)

I've made a few modifications and additions to Reuben's code, most notably:

- Elusive bug fixes
- Addition of functionality to the media section (http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_WordPress_API/Media)
- Addition of code enabling logging (pretty badly written, but just a rough fix)

Do feel free to fork this project, build on it, go wild!! Be sure to give back to the project, though.
